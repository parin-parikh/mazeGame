# Maze Game with Matter.js

## Overview

Welcome to the Maze Game project! This is a simple web-based maze game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the physics engine Matter.js. The objective of the game is to navigate a ball through a randomly generated maze to reach the goal.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that renders the game interface. This file also contains the styles for the game layout and appearance.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file where the game logic is implemented using Matter.js.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parin-parikh/mazeGame.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to start the game.

## Gameplay Instructions

- **Objective**: Navigate the ball through the maze to reach the goal.
- **Controls**: Use WASD keys to control the ball. You can also use the mouse, but it's not optimized due to Matter.js limitations.

## Features

- **Random Maze Generation**: A new maze is generated every time the game is refreshed or when you click "Play Again" after reaching the goal.
- **Responsive Controls**: Control the ball using either the WASD keys or the mouse.

## How It Works

The game leverages Matter.js to handle physics and collisions. The maze is generated dynamically, providing a unique experience in each playthrough. The user can control the ball through keyboard input or mouse movement.
